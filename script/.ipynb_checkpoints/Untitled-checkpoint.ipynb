Lars\\'s expertise in the media and tech space, combined with their drive to integrate compliance with enterprise AI usage, positions them well to solve the identified problems.\\n\\n**Why now?**  \\nThe increasing awareness and regulatory framework around data protection in AI, particularly in Europe with laws such as the EU AI Act, make Nana AI\\'s solution timely and relevant for enterprises looking to maintain compliance while harnessing AI technology.\\n\\n**Too hyped?**  \\nWhile AI and data privacy solutions are trending, the specific approach of enabling organizations to use AI while maintaining compliance is not overly hyped; it meets a real market need.\\n\\n**Too greedy?**  \\nThe growth plans appear realistic. With structured pricing and targeted revenue goals, the ARR and revenue forecasts seem achievable given their market focus.\\n\\n## In-depth part:\\n\\n**ICP**  \\n- Ideal Customer Profile: B2B companies, particularly in the legal, finance, and healthcare sectors, looking for compliance solutions related to data protection.  \\n- Company size: Medium to large enterprises, interested in a multi-seat licensing model.  \\n- Geography: Primarily Germany and the EU.\\n\\n**Addressed problem**  \\nNana AI addresses the issue of data privacy violations in AI usage, a major concern for enterprises under scrutiny due to increasing regulations. Approximately 70% of companies in Germany report such violations.\\n\\n**Team**  \\n- Lars Moll: Extensive experience in media and digital departments, focusing on B2B SaaS and startup ecosystems.  \\n- Alexander: Expertise in technical roles, previously led two exits in B2B/SaaS, understanding of data compliance and user needs.\\n\\n**Market**  \\nThe market focuses on enterprise software solutions that ensure compliance with data regulations while utilizing AI technologies. The B2B sector in the EU, with a particular emphasis on the DACH region, is experiencing increased demand for such services.\\n\\n**Sales**  \\nThey are currently engaging in unpaid pilot projects with legal and financial agencies, aiming to convert these into paying clients by the end of the year. They aim to close five clients as part of their go-to-market strategy.\\n\\n**Product**  \\nNana AI\\'s product is a browser extension that masks personal and sensitive data while employees use large language models (LLMs). It consists of a \"shield\" for data protection, \"guardrails\" for usage compliance, and an analytics cockpit for monitoring AI interaction by employees.\\n\\n**Competition**  \\nCompetitors in the space include other compliance and data protection software solutions. Nana AI differentiates itself through its unique enablement platform that not only protects data but also facilitates AI usage among employees without hindering productivity.\\n\\n**Problems?**  \\nThere are no specific IP or cap table issues mentioned during the call; however, the founders need to navigate their product development in line with regulatory requirements.\\n\\n**Current funding situation**  \\n- Previous funding: Angel investment of approximately 300k euros with a post-money valuation of 2.5 million euros.  \\n- Type: Angel investment.\\n\\n**Raising funding**  \\nNana AI is seeking to raise between 1.5 to 2 million euros at a valuation of 10 million euros to support scaling efforts, focusing on team expansion, product development, and marketing strategies. They aim to close this round by the end of the year or early next year.\\n\\n## Q&A\\n- **Q:** What is the current revenue?  \\n  **A:** Currently no revenue; aiming for 180-200k ARR by year-end.\\n\\n- **Q:** What are your revenue goals?  \\n  **A:** Target of 800k total revenue next year.\\n\\n- **Q:** Can you describe your product?  \\n  **A:** It’s a browser extension that secures personal data while using LLMs, ensuring EU regulation compliance.\\n\\n- **Q:** Where are you targeting?  \\n  **A:** Primarily in Germany and the EU, focusing on legal and financial sectors.\\n\\n- **Q:** What\\'s the next step for funding?  \\n  **A:** Looking to raise between 1.5 to 2 million euros at a valuation of 10 million euros.', 'nenna.ai')\n"

All right, where are you located?\\n- Ghent, Belgium.\\n- I don't know if you're familiar.\\n- Okay, okay.\\n- You're Berlin based, right?\\n- Okay.\\n- So you probably have like around the same weather as we have here in Belgium.\\n- Like a lot of rain.\\n- A lot.\\n- But normally a lot of rain and gray.\\n- Yeah, yeah.\\n- No, no.\\n- Nice to hear.\\n- Yeah.\\n- No, I came across what you're doing, I think, through LinkedIn and I was intrigued.\\n- We were looking like, or we're starting to look a bit into the space of like the AI.\\n- Like, I don't know how you specifically would call the subsection that you're working in, but we're looking at the privacy protection in AI and like the.\\n- Just in general, how enterprises can use it and was intrigued.\\n- So, yeah, I don't know how familiar you are with us from the other perspective.\\n- So if it's okay, I'll give a quick introduction.\\n- So we're both up to speed.\\n- So you know what our investment thesis is and.\\n- Yeah, just interrupt me if anything would be unclear.\\n- Yeah, Great.\\n- Yeah.\\n- So quickly.\\n- Entourage itself.\\n- The idea itself started a bit before Entourage Ito by our managing partner, Peter Gambaze, founding and leading a company called Chopin, which is a B2B SaaS company.\\n- He led that from 0 to 100 million plus ARR during 12 years.\\n- Ish.\\n- And in that period he also did a lot of angel investments that kind of grew out to be the idea of Entourage.\\n- Entourage is of course, not only Patreon.\\n- We also have two other amazing partners who are also former show patterns.\\n- We have the former cto Machten, who leads more of our studio effort.\\n- The studio part is where we still work on our own ideas, have entrepreneurs in residence, etc.\\n- On the other side, we have the capital part, which is led by Evert, which was the former chief of staff at Chopet.\\n- And yeah, it's more of a traditional VC.\\n- We invest in early stage B2B SaaS companies.\\n- Our main focus is like the European geography.\\n- We also do uk, us, but yeah, that's like our main focus in general.\\n- To quickly get like the bullet points away.\\n- Our ticket size is between 300k and 1.5 million.\\n- We like to be flexible.\\n- We can lead, co lead or follow in rounds.\\n- And yeah, we started fairly recently, like seven months ago.\\n- We publicly launched in the time.\\n- We already have nine portfolio companies, so we're really actively deploying.\\n- And yeah, that's a quick, quick Rundown I can give you there.\\n- I don't know if I forgot anything.\\n- Yeah, personally I have a computer science background, worked a bit in the tech scene, really enjoyed the startup tech scene, really enjoyed the startup ecosystem itself.\\n- Don't need to explain that part to you, I don't think.\\n- And yeah, I kind of wanted to see what the dark side was, what the investment side was, and here I am.\\n- So yeah, I don't know if anything is unclear or.\\n- Great to meet you.\\n- Where is the, where's the headquarter or where's the company located?\\n- Also Belgium.\\n- Ghent.\\n- Belgium.\\n- So okay, okay, so it's in European.\\n- European, yeah.\\n- Okay, great.\\n- And okay, so I can do an introduction myself.\\n- So you're looking for early stage.\\n- Yeah, 300 to 1.5 million.\\n- And how much companies do you have?\\n- Have you already invested in?\\n- More or less.\\n- So currently as mentioned, we have nine portfolio companies, but in the scope of those, it's like as you mentioned, we're industry agnostic.\\n- So it's a bit of a lot of different sectors itself, but just B2B SaaS companies in general.\\n- We also have one cybersecurity company which might be like the closest thing like sector wise to what you're doing with Aikido, who are doing really well.\\n- Yeah.\\n- All right, what would be the process?\\n- How would you like to handle it?\\n- So I mean I will do a short introduction, I can tell you something about our product and go to market and all that stuff.\\n- But what would, how would the process look like in general?\\n- You mean like bigger view or do you mean just of this meeting?\\n- Yeah, like no, this meeting and then the potential next steps.\\n- Just to quick rundown from this meeting.\\n- This is like introductory, introductory.\\n- So in this, whatever is most comfortable for you.\\n- I'd just like to see and hear what you're doing, what the, what the dynamic is between the founders, what your current metrics are.\\n- And yeah, also what you're searching from us like have like a bit of a, you know, understanding that you know who we are, that we know who you are.\\n- And yeah, to go higher level of like what our potential next steps are, it also always depends on, you know, your timeline of course as well.\\n- But yeah, potential next steps is meeting with a partner probably ever in that part, in that sense.\\n- And then it just depends on how it flows.\\n- But in general we have a few meetings with the partners.\\n- As mentioned, we have Martin, who is like our ct, like was former cto, is really tech savvy most of the times, also meets with the CTO and Then also meeting with the managing partner.\\n- It just involves in like our due diligence and you know, trying to find if it's a match.\\n- All right, cool.\\n- Okay, thank you.\\n- Yeah, today.\\n- Yeah.\\n- Like how you like the introduction itself?\\n- For me it's like whatever you're most comfortable with.\\n- If you're a pitcher, you like to give a quick pitch deck.\\n- All good for me.\\n- If you're more of a discussion person.\\n- All good for me as well.\\n- If you like to do something hybrid, also good for me.\\n- I just like to see what you're doing and the format doesn't really matter for me.\\n- All right.\\n- Yeah.\\n- So we have just half an hour.\\n- I would suggest I do a short introduction.\\n- I would jump in and so you will have an idea on what, what, what we're working on.\\n- Have, did you know what we're doing?\\n- I mean in general.\\n- Have you had a look on our website or should I just start from scratch?\\n- I, I looked at it for a bit, but I like to hear what you, how you would give like your elevator pitch.\\n- Just quickly run through it.\\n- All right.\\n- Yeah.\\n- I'm, I'm a co founder and I recently started as CEO of the company as and the founder is Alexander who is as well the technical founder and we are right now six people in the company and we hire three people.\\n- So marketing manager, two developers are going to start like within the next two weeks.\\n- So we'll be approximately with freelancers, almost 10 people working on the project.\\n- And my role is sales, marketing, finance.\\n- And so I'm here today to present you the product.\\n- But if you would like to meet the whole team, we can do it in the next call, the next step when we should or could talk to a partner.\\n- So what we do is we do data protection during the direct use of AI with large language models.\\n- So we cover personal data and intellectual property while using every single large language model.\\n- So this is our usp.\\n- We, we are software that is distributed via browser, Edge and Chrome.\\n- So there's a huge problem in the EU and in Germany with the shadow usage.\\n- You don't know what your employees are putting in large language models.\\n- And then we have this EUI act law and we cover.\\n- We are not like.\\n- We do not prohibit personal data like people to work with it.\\n- We enable people to work with it by masking personal data.\\n- The large language model can work with it and by de masking it when you would work further with it by copying text into email or Word.\\n- And I, I can show you some screens and I will share my screen now, so maybe that's maybe quickly for.\\n- The Chrome and Edge.\\n- Is that just with an extension in the browser or what.\\n- What is the like product itself?\\n- It's an.\\n- It's more or less is an extension.\\n- Yeah.\\n- And it's a software, so it's for companies.\\n- It's B2B SaaS.\\n- As an enterprise, you would buy a number of seats for your employees and you would roll it.\\n- The roller will be over your IT infrastructure and then it would sit in the, in the browser people are working with.\\n- So and then it's able to cover any large language model.\\n- Okay, perfect.\\n- Let me see if this is working.\\n- All right.\\n- You see that?\\n- Yes.\\n- Let me check where I have to work.\\n- Okay.\\n- You see the screen?\\n- Yes.\\n- Okay.\\n- Okay.\\n- So I mean that's a problem in the beginning.\\n- You can tell me how much I should talk about the program.\\n- But I mean we know that AI is critical for companies to be more efficient, boost in productivity.\\n- I think we don't need to talk about that.\\n- Still.\\n- It's in the presentation.\\n- The thing is that 70% of companies in Germany identify data privacy violations while using AI.\\n- So a lot of companies are stopping or do not let their employees work with AI as much as they could or not at all.\\n- And this is leading to competitive disadvantage to and to a huge loss of efficiency boost right now.\\n- So 40% of workers use bent AI tool even though they are not allowed to.\\n- This is like the shadow usage I was talking about.\\n- And this is huge problem because you have this DSG4.0, this data privacy law in Europe and the UAI Act.\\n- And yes, and this is something we are going to solve because three problems.\\n- AI is used by any B2B Z tool.\\n- You have a broad shadow usage and you have enterprise data that is gold for AI, but you're not collecting it.\\n- You know, as an enterprise you have a lot of people playing around with ChatGPT or whatever, doing translations, doing creative things with large language models.\\n- And as a company you're not able to see it.\\n- You know, there is like a lot of gold and data people spending the time working with large language models.\\n- They will be trained with the data and not only the security risk, but even like intellectual property is leaving your house and your company and you're not collecting it.\\n- And this is something what we want to enable.\\n- So we want to control the usage data security, but we want to enable the workforce and the company to solve all these problems.\\n- So we are not just a data security company.\\n- We have an enterprise enablement platform to secure AI to govern AI and to adopt AI to have insights on your internal AI usage and to scale it with own AI models.\\n- In the end there is a platform for management or executives to like directly look at the usage and like look at which like how privatizes that, like.\\n- How, how much is like an anonymous.\\n- It's not like pair employee, it's like per department or whatever.\\n- You know, if you, if you have these.\\n- We have four layers in the platform.\\n- There's a shield.\\n- The shield protects the, the usage, the sensitive data.\\n- I show you the shield in a minute.\\n- Then there are guardrails.\\n- So if you drag a PDF or Word document within a large language model, there's a NANA AI overlay that tells you you're dragging a Word document in it.\\n- We can cover the personal information, you can check it beforehand.\\n- And as a company you can tell NANA AI to not allow an upload of contracts or not allow an upload of CVS or whatever or PDF in general.\\n- And you can steer the usage of AI.\\n- You can prohibit to use various LLMs.\\n- You can say I don't want this LLM to be used, I want this to be used more often or whatever.\\n- So you can, you have these guardrails which you can steer the whole AI usage and then you have the insights.\\n- And that was your question.\\n- You know, you have like, you can see like in a cockpit which LLMs are used by your stuff.\\n- What are the prompts, what are they using it for?\\n- And but with this knowledge you are able to build your own processes on it.\\n- You can tell if people are doing a lot of translation.\\n- You can think of how to optimize that for example, or if people are doing a lot of, I don't know, ideation for special topics.\\n- You are able to see this and you are able to give them best practices how to prompt and even we are able to push best practices of prompts to the employee while writing on a prompt because we know what works best.\\n- So you are not able just not only protecting the data, when you have installed Nano, you are able to see what they are working on.\\n- You're able to steal within your company.\\n- Not intercompany wise with data regulation.\\n- That must not be possible.\\n- It's just within a company.\\n- Okay.\\n- And this is the same thing.\\n- Yeah.\\n- So we secure the data and people are able to work with LLMs.\\n- We have higher productivity, we do this governance stuff.\\n- So we have no liability risk.\\n- We do this adoption with the insight.\\n- So it's your data and it's the first time that you have like usage data with various LLMs, then you have a competitive advantage because you can scale that.\\n- This is how it looks like.\\n- You have the device of the employee that are installed and if it's contacts or emails or documents or whatever, you can use all AI services.\\n- But the personal data is not leaving the device of the employee.\\n- And this is why it's EU AI act and with compliance with data law in EU and in Germany, because it's not leaving the device of the employee.\\n- To zoom in into the EU AI Act.\\n- How enforced is that?\\n- Has there been any fines or how should I see this?\\n- There will be, there will be.\\n- The companies need to be more or less ready mid of next year and next year and they need to show that they are compliant with the UAI act.\\n- And there will be like there is the US building an AI, I call Task Force, different name right now and they're going to look into it.\\n- And even this, oh, what is the word in English like you know, kpmg, Pricewater.\\n- First they will look into it and see if you're compliant when it comes to this.\\n- Annual.\\n- Inspections of like an audit or like an audit.\\n- It's like an art.\\n- Yeah.\\n- And you need to be compliant and if not there is a risk of fees.\\n- You have to.\\n- And is that one of the selling points that like if you pitch this to some like a company, is that like one of the first things that you pitch as well in there?\\n- Yes, it depends, you know, and we are not.\\n- This is a huge reason for people.\\n- We do some pilot cases right now and we do demos with companies in Germany, for example, publishing houses, with legal firms and with agencies.\\n- And some see this efficiency boost.\\n- Some are like, oh, now I can work with it.\\n- This is great, you know, because I can let people I don't know compare CVS because the personal data is not in the CVS anymore.\\n- You know, something like they see the user case.\\n- But some are like, I met someone last week who told me this is a solution for all my legal problems with this data security stuff in the UAI act because they're really afraid of how should I deal with this shadow usage.\\n- You know, maybe quickly one you mentioned, for example CVS just, just to get a better understanding also out of PDFs you can filter out.\\n- Yes, in PDF.\\n- I show you, I show you in a minute.\\n- Let's, let's jump into the product.\\n- Look, this is like Nana AI secures any itool because we are a plugin in the browser Chrome in Edge.\\n- So we have it installed.\\n- You see it in the front end, you have this, you have this layer and you can choose if it's on or it's off.\\n- As a company you do default settings but just like you can say where it's on, normally it's on.\\n- So it's there as a layer.\\n- And then you have the shield here in the middle.\\n- It controls the usage of AI with PAI and IP on the device of the employee.\\n- So and then you have the governance cockpit and as a company or your enterprise AI team you can, you can tell Nana what is allowed and what is not allowed.\\n- The employee cannot change it, you know, and this is like the rule set you set as a company and then they're able to work with it and you have to shield on the, on the computer of the employees.\\n- And during the usage you gain the insights I talked about beforehand.\\n- And it looks like this.\\n- You have the browser plugin and if this is a chatgpt prompt, you see that there are names and there is a street and there's a city and a bank account and this is like the mail to I think an insurance company.\\n- Do you recognize that with your own LLM or how do you recognize that?\\n- Well, but we have a recognition software as part of our.\\n- And that's run locally or how does that work?\\n- It's run locally, yeah.\\n- Okay, so in the true the browser itself or is there is it just an on premise cloud that you need to use for that or how does that work?\\n- Through the browser?\\n- Through the browser.\\n- Through the browser.\\n- So in the browser you run that.\\n- Okay, interesting.\\n- And do you also have like the platform itself?\\n- So you mentioned you can see the usage etc do you also have like screenshots or something of a demo of that insights?\\n- Not right now.\\n- This is what we.\\n- I show you in a minute.\\n- This is like the insight is the next step, right?\\n- What's life right now is the shield and the guardrails.\\n- Okay.\\n- And the Insights are going to be launched begin beginning of next year.\\n- Okay.\\n- And you see that okay, this is a prompt that I do you know and what Nana is doing.\\n- You see that the person becomes like this.\\n- The name is.\\n- The LLM knows that it's a person and that is an email.\\n- That is a phone number.\\n- And the LLM knows that this.\\n- So you can compare CVS for example because you know which person it is but just with this mask ask thing, you know.\\n- So you have this on your fly masking company brands, phone number, whatever.\\n- As a company you can do, I don't know, you can upload a set of 1,000 data points that you would like to have masked like brand names, client names, whatever.\\n- And then the prompt is going to the LLM and it's no sensitive data or personal data.\\n- With the LLM it stays on.\\n- On premise of the, of the employee.\\n- So the prompt output is working.\\n- So here the subject was to write an email.\\n- So it writes an email, it says dear Person, dear State, and then you copy this into your email program or Word or whatever and de mask the content and the name is there again, the bank account is there again, everything is there again.\\n- And this happens on the computer of the employee.\\n- So the LLM hasn't seen any sensitive data.\\n- This is why it's compliant with data law.\\n- And this is what you were asking.\\n- If I drag a Word or PDF file into the browser, there is this nanoshield and it says you're uploading a PDF file.\\n- It is masked.\\n- Please check it before and so you can check it and then you see that with the PDF.\\n- Yes, but with PDF you cannot retrieve the data.\\n- It's just cover and that's it.\\n- With Word it works like the same way as I showed you in the.\\n- In the prompt and with the PDFs.\\n- Does it?\\n- Is it only for searchable PDFs that this is doable or does it.\\n- Is it also working for like non searchable PDFs?\\n- I'm not sure.\\n- Okay.\\n- I think it works with any PDF.\\n- What is.\\n- Yeah, like you know the, the PDF, sorry, you can like select the text and then you have PDF so you can't.\\n- I'm not the technical guy, but I think it works with all PDFs.\\n- Yeah, yeah.\\n- And we can show you.\\n- But we can show you a demo if you're interested.\\n- A live demo of this.\\n- Maybe for the time's sake, not now, but like I definitely.\\n- If you have like a video or something or do you have like a clip of it?\\n- No, I just have the screens right now.\\n- Okay, I know.\\n- If you would.\\n- Yeah, we'll leave that for now because I think there's still a few things to do for time's sake.\\n- I think the live demo is hard to see.\\n- I'm done in three minutes.\\n- So you see this data show policy details and whatever.\\n- So you can use in different ways as a copy.\\n- You can use it just as to be data safe.\\n- And you say no personal data, no documents or whatever.\\n- And so you're in control of the shadow usage.\\n- But this is, let's say, the default case.\\n- The more interesting case is to say what is allowed and let people work with it and not stopping the usage of AI in your company.\\n- We have free packages, we have like it depends on the seat and of the functions you have.\\n- So it starts with a team that's up to 20 seats, department is up to 150 seat enterprises up to 1000 seats and only with department you are able to start using these insights.\\n- And as an enterprise you can do own insight models, own shield models and a custom AI.\\n- This is not something we would do with a team, you know, you see, let's say the bigger it gets, the more individualization is there and the more you can, you can build your own functions with our tools.\\n- So team is more or less what you see is what you get, you know.\\n- And with enterprise you have more or less strategic partnership and you're working on how they really would like to work with these insights and have more functions within the shield and not just like the standard thing.\\n- And how does that work pricing wise?\\n- What should I like per seat or per company or.\\n- I don't know how you do pricing.\\n- Yeah, we are middle.\\n- We are the 20 seats are like.\\n- €300Amonth or just in general.\\n- Or in general.\\n- In general, yeah.\\n- So we are looking for a long term login effect, you know, because as an enterprise if you have NANA installed, you have the shield and the guardrails.\\n- But because with our tool you're able to have these insight and custom AI.\\n- Yeah, we call it gravity.\\n- We have this gravity effect or login effect that we are not just a protection software, we are an ailment software.\\n- And it makes sense to work with us over a longer period of time and for not just for teams but for whole enterprises.\\n- These are the sectors we are looking in.\\n- Legal, we're working legal agencies, finance, you know, where data protection is very important as well Health and insurance and public sector and as well E commerce.\\n- But right now we are focusing on legal agencies and finance and we are building pilot cases there.\\n- These are with agencies.\\n- Do you mean consultancy or what kind of agencies?\\n- Yeah, like yes, agencies.\\n- Like yes, it's good question.\\n- Like different kind of agencies.\\n- It's like could be brand agencies or marketing agencies, but they work with sensitive data as well.\\n- You know when they are creating intellectual property or they don't want the large language model to know which client you're talking about.\\n- Now it's done.\\n- Okay, perfect.\\n- These are some use cases.\\n- I will spare them right now.\\n- But this is legal.\\n- You have to compare contract versions, automate emails, confidential data, CVS and hr.\\n- This is like the agency stuff, idea generation Texting translation We have pilot cases in legal consulting and marketing right now and we are negotiating reselling partners.\\n- So they.\\n- It's a great distribution model for us because this is like a legal partner and a consulting agency and we have B2B pilots, their agencies.\\n- There is a publishing and invest investment.\\n- Houses as well to quickly zoom into that.\\n- So like traction wise, how does that work?\\n- Pilot cases, is that paid?\\n- Not paid.\\n- And.\\n- Cases are demo cases that are not paid right now.\\n- But the idea is to turn them into clients.\\n- We do these pilot cases for free just to enter the market.\\n- But the objective to end of year is to have five clients closed.\\n- And what kind of action should you get out of that?\\n- Or what are you aiming for?\\n- Like traction wise, MRR or ARR wise?\\n- Out of those end of year?\\n- Yes.\\n- Yeah, it's ARR.\\n- End of year is more or less like 180 200,000.\\n- And currently.\\n- There'S no revenue.\\n- Yeah, we're like we started go to market beginning of October, but next year we are aiming at 800k.\\n- Okay.\\n- Total revenue, not ARR total.\\n- Because there's a lot of service fee in the setup itself or just currently.\\n- No, it's, it's.\\n- It's the seats and the contracts.\\n- Yeah.\\n- So it is ARR.\\n- Yeah.\\n- Excuse me.\\n- So, so wait, you mentioned that the 800k is not ARR, but what is there like service associated?\\n- Like total net revenue next year but.\\n- Like just a part of that is service based or why, why is it not ARR?\\n- Ah, okay.\\n- No, ARR is.\\n- Ah, no, for the next year the ARR is even higher when it comes to the yearly contracts and stuff like this.\\n- It's not ARR because it's a total annual revenue, not recurring revenue, you know.\\n- Yeah, so it's not recurring because there's service fees included in that 800k or why is it not recurring?\\n- Service fees in it?\\n- Yes.\\n- Okay.\\n- And how much?\\n- Even higher because you have like I show you where is it?\\n- So we start right now with just team setup and next year we have department clients and enterprise clients.\\n- And let's assume that the enterprise client is stepping in like in March or in June and they have a yearly contract or even longer.\\n- So this is how I understand it.\\n- The total revenue next year, the ARR for 2026, well end of 2025 is more than 800k.\\n- Okay, perfect.\\n- Yeah, maybe for sake.\\n- I'll try to like quickly go through the other questions.\\n- So like two quick ones.\\n- So you mentioned something with the founder setup.\\n- I'm not completely Clear of what?\\n- What, like how it currently works.\\n- So you have Alexander, he's moving into more of a CTO function.\\n- And you're joining as like a founder, as a CEO, right?\\n- Or is that misunderstood?\\n- Let's say I do the thing, a lot of the outbound stuff, events, marketing, sales.\\n- And Alex is the founder, the technical brain and he's doing a lot of investor relations as well.\\n- But you're joining more as like your late joining founder or how should I see that?\\n- No, I was a very early founder, but I was working with a media company and digital department 12 years and my terms of notice was, were like six months.\\n- So I was.\\n- I co founded in May, but I just, I could start right now.\\n- Yeah.\\n- Alex is a founder.\\n- He did two exit within B2B and SaaS companies.\\n- Alexis is a CTO, like the operating CTO.\\n- And Florian is a business development.\\n- Yeah.\\n- And maybe to zoom in, like just a quick question, like the website itself is like fully in German.\\n- Is that because your current focus is just the German market or how should I see that?\\n- This is something we see as a usp.\\n- We communicate in German because we want to have trust.\\n- We start in German, or let's say Dach as a German company and we want to build trust.\\n- We do not want to be a company that is seated.\\n- I don't know, somewhere.\\n- We want to show our clients that we understand European law and German law and data protection and that we work with local servers only and all the tools we are using are compliant with data law, even our CRM.\\n- So we want to build trust by communicating in German and we want to start in German market.\\n- Yeah, I see that we're over the time limit.\\n- Can I quickly grab like two more minutes or do you have a back to back?\\n- Okay, sorry.\\n- No worries.\\n- Sorry for interrupting.\\n- I just wanted to ensure.\\n- No.\\n- And the tool Nana AI is able to work in English.\\n- Okay.\\n- But we are focusing go to markets in Germany.\\n- Right?\\n- Okay.\\n- Yeah, no, definitely.\\n- Interesting.\\n- And maybe to zoom into that like competition wise, how would you say, how would you place yourself in the space itself?\\n- Like what is your main differentiator in comparison to.\\n- So for the German thing made in Germany, we position ourselves that we are like.\\n- We understand data, but we are an enablement platform.\\n- I haven't seen our idea before and there's a lot of guardrail stuff and IT security and custom AI.\\n- But we have a different approach when it comes to how you protect and enable people.\\n- Because we sit there where the employees are working with AI.\\n- We do not build like we are easy to install.\\n- You can roll us roll out our software very fast and in a simple way.\\n- And you do not need to build like huge IT infrastructures first and then understand how you are going to develop an own LLM and stuff.\\n- Because we suggest in front of it.\\n- So we our USP is that we make data protection feasible and possible with any AI.\\n- So this is something we haven't seen in the market and this is very special.\\n- And then it's for German companies.\\n- Okay, maybe interesting to look at.\\n- I just sent it in chat Collider.\\n- They're like an Italian company who is like in a similar space.\\n- Might be interesting for you to look at as well.\\n- Of course as you mentioned, if one of your differentiators is currently like chairman.\\n- It's different but might be interesting to see them as well.\\n- Yeah.\\n- Maybe to quickly look into like what you're searching for.\\n- Like are you currently raising or what is your timeline raising wise.\\n- We have angel investment.\\n- Okay.\\n- These are our angels and they support us by with the go to market.\\n- A lot of knowledge in B2B SaaS and agency as well.\\n- What we are looking for right now we have an angel invest of approximately 300k with a post money evaluation of 2.5 million and we are looking into 1.5 to 2 million let's say end of year, beginning of next year to be able to scale and to be able to invest in marketing and more people team stuffing sales and building the product.\\n- So ideally you would be done raising before your revenue.\\n- Like it would be like kind of a pre revenue round because you mentioned or like you mentioned that you're trying to get the revenue like end of year.\\n- Yeah.\\n- So it's like starting to be there.\\n- Okay.\\n- Yeah.\\n- And what kind of valuation are you looking at for the 1.5 to 2?\\n- We need to talk about that.\\n- Do you have like a range?\\n- I don't want to like hard fit you to something but I just want like if there's a range that you already have in mind.\\n- Yeah.\\n- For what?\\n- Yeah, for us it would be to pose to be a 10 million evaluation and total web.\\n- Okay.\\n- I know it's in no way to like.\\n- I just need like based on the.\\n- Model and the setup and what kind of investment it is.\\n- So you know I'm.\\n- I was just.\\n- It's hard to say if you do not know the.\\n- I totally.\\n- It's just like as mentioned like I have an internal debrief about this later and it's just easier if I have like some guidelines of what the amount is.\\n- It's in no way to, like, have a gotcha moment after this, so no worries about that.\\n- Yeah, no, definitely.\\n- Interesting.\\n- Thank you for your time.\\n- I really enjoyed hearing about it.\\n- Really interesting space as well.\\n- And, yeah, as mentioned, I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible with potential next steps.\\n- If you could send me your slides as well, that would make my life a bit easier.\\n- Yeah.\\n- Thank you so much.\\n- Yeah, of course.\\n- Thank you very much.\\n- Have a nice day.\\n-

      "Transcript:\n",
      "- Thank you.\n",
      "- Hello.\n",
      "- How's it going?\n",
      "- Going great.\n",
      "- The weather is good, so, you know, it's not hard to be happy for today.\n",
      "- All right, where are you located?\n",
      "- Ghent, Belgium.\n",
      "- I don't know if you're familiar.\n",
      "- Okay, okay.\n",
      "- You're Berlin based, right?\n",
      "- Okay.\n",
      "- So you probably have like around the same weather as we have here in Belgium.\n",
      "- Like a lot of rain.\n",
      "- A lot.\n",
      "- But normally a lot of rain and gray.\n",
      "- Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "- No, no.\n",
      "- Nice to hear.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- No, I came across what you're doing, I think, through LinkedIn and I was intrigued.\n",
      "- We were looking like, or we're starting to look a bit into the space of like the AI.\n",
      "- Like, I don't know how you specifically would call the subsection that you're working in, but we're looking at the privacy protection in AI and like the.\n",
      "- Just in general, how enterprises can use it and was intrigued.\n",
      "- So, yeah, I don't know how familiar you are with us from the other perspective.\n",
      "- So if it's okay, I'll give a quick introduction.\n",
      "- So we're both up to speed.\n",
      "- So you know what our investment thesis is and.\n",
      "- Yeah, just interrupt me if anything would be unclear.\n",
      "- Yeah, Great.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- So quickly.\n",
      "- Entourage itself.\n",
      "- The idea itself started a bit before Entourage Ito by our managing partner, Peter Gambaze, founding and leading a company called Chopin, which is a B2B SaaS company.\n",
      "- He led that from 0 to 100 million plus ARR during 12 years.\n",
      "- Ish.\n",
      "- And in that period he also did a lot of angel investments that kind of grew out to be the idea of Entourage.\n",
      "- Entourage is of course, not only Patreon.\n",
      "- We also have two other amazing partners who are also former show patterns.\n",
      "- We have the former cto Machten, who leads more of our studio effort.\n",
      "- The studio part is where we still work on our own ideas, have entrepreneurs in residence, etc.\n",
      "- On the other side, we have the capital part, which is led by Evert, which was the former chief of staff at Chopet.\n",
      "- And yeah, it's more of a traditional VC.\n",
      "- We invest in early stage B2B SaaS companies.\n",
      "- Our main focus is like the European geography.\n",
      "- We also do uk, us, but yeah, that's like our main focus in general.\n",
      "- To quickly get like the bullet points away.\n",
      "- Our ticket size is between 300k and 1.5 million.\n",
      "- We like to be flexible.\n",
      "- We can lead, co lead or follow in rounds.\n",
      "- And yeah, we started fairly recently, like seven months ago.\n",
      "- We publicly launched in the time.\n",
      "- We already have nine portfolio companies, so we're really actively deploying.\n",
      "- And yeah, that's a quick, quick Rundown I can give you there.\n",
      "- I don't know if I forgot anything.\n",
      "- Yeah, personally I have a computer science background, worked a bit in the tech scene, really enjoyed the startup tech scene, really enjoyed the startup ecosystem itself.\n",
      "- Don't need to explain that part to you, I don't think.\n",
      "- And yeah, I kind of wanted to see what the dark side was, what the investment side was, and here I am.\n",
      "- So yeah, I don't know if anything is unclear or.\n",
      "- Great to meet you.\n",
      "- Where is the, where's the headquarter or where's the company located?\n",
      "- Also Belgium.\n",
      "- Ghent.\n",
      "- Belgium.\n",
      "- So okay, okay, so it's in European.\n",
      "- European, yeah.\n",
      "- Okay, great.\n",
      "- And okay, so I can do an introduction myself.\n",
      "- So you're looking for early stage.\n",
      "- Yeah, 300 to 1.5 million.\n",
      "- And how much companies do you have?\n",
      "- Have you already invested in?\n",
      "- More or less.\n",
      "- So currently as mentioned, we have nine portfolio companies, but in the scope of those, it's like as you mentioned, we're industry agnostic.\n",
      "- So it's a bit of a lot of different sectors itself, but just B2B SaaS companies in general.\n",
      "- We also have one cybersecurity company which might be like the closest thing like sector wise to what you're doing with Aikido, who are doing really well.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- All right, what would be the process?\n",
      "- How would you like to handle it?\n",
      "- So I mean I will do a short introduction, I can tell you something about our product and go to market and all that stuff.\n",
      "- But what would, how would the process look like in general?\n",
      "- You mean like bigger view or do you mean just of this meeting?\n",
      "- Yeah, like no, this meeting and then the potential next steps.\n",
      "- Just to quick rundown from this meeting.\n",
      "- This is like introductory, introductory.\n",
      "- So in this, whatever is most comfortable for you.\n",
      "- I'd just like to see and hear what you're doing, what the, what the dynamic is between the founders, what your current metrics are.\n",
      "- And yeah, also what you're searching from us like have like a bit of a, you know, understanding that you know who we are, that we know who you are.\n",
      "- And yeah, to go higher level of like what our potential next steps are, it also always depends on, you know, your timeline of course as well.\n",
      "- But yeah, potential next steps is meeting with a partner probably ever in that part, in that sense.\n",
      "- And then it just depends on how it flows.\n",
      "- But in general we have a few meetings with the partners.\n",
      "- As mentioned, we have Martin, who is like our ct, like was former cto, is really tech savvy most of the times, also meets with the CTO and Then also meeting with the managing partner.\n",
      "- It just involves in like our due diligence and you know, trying to find if it's a match.\n",
      "- All right, cool.\n",
      "- Okay, thank you.\n",
      "- Yeah, today.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- Like how you like the introduction itself?\n",
      "- For me it's like whatever you're most comfortable with.\n",
      "- If you're a pitcher, you like to give a quick pitch deck.\n",
      "- All good for me.\n",
      "- If you're more of a discussion person.\n",
      "- All good for me as well.\n",
      "- If you like to do something hybrid, also good for me.\n",
      "- I just like to see what you're doing and the format doesn't really matter for me.\n",
      "- All right.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- So we have just half an hour.\n",
      "- I would suggest I do a short introduction.\n",
      "- I would jump in and so you will have an idea on what, what, what we're working on.\n",
      "- Have, did you know what we're doing?\n",
      "- I mean in general.\n",
      "- Have you had a look on our website or should I just start from scratch?\n",
      "- I, I looked at it for a bit, but I like to hear what you, how you would give like your elevator pitch.\n",
      "- Just quickly run through it.\n",
      "- All right.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- I'm, I'm a co founder and I recently started as CEO of the company as and the founder is Alexander who is as well the technical founder and we are right now six people in the company and we hire three people.\n",
      "- So marketing manager, two developers are going to start like within the next two weeks.\n",
      "- So we'll be approximately with freelancers, almost 10 people working on the project.\n",
      "- And my role is sales, marketing, finance.\n",
      "- And so I'm here today to present you the product.\n",
      "- But if you would like to meet the whole team, we can do it in the next call, the next step when we should or could talk to a partner.\n",
      "- So what we do is we do data protection during the direct use of AI with large language models.\n",
      "- So we cover personal data and intellectual property while using every single large language model.\n",
      "- So this is our usp.\n",
      "- We, we are software that is distributed via browser, Edge and Chrome.\n",
      "- So there's a huge problem in the EU and in Germany with the shadow usage.\n",
      "- You don't know what your employees are putting in large language models.\n",
      "- And then we have this EUI act law and we cover.\n",
      "- We are not like.\n",
      "- We do not prohibit personal data like people to work with it.\n",
      "- We enable people to work with it by masking personal data.\n",
      "- The large language model can work with it and by de masking it when you would work further with it by copying text into email or Word.\n",
      "- And I, I can show you some screens and I will share my screen now, so maybe that's maybe quickly for.\n",
      "- The Chrome and Edge.\n",
      "- Is that just with an extension in the browser or what.\n",
      "- What is the like product itself?\n",
      "- It's an.\n",
      "- It's more or less is an extension.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- And it's a software, so it's for companies.\n",
      "- It's B2B SaaS.\n",
      "- As an enterprise, you would buy a number of seats for your employees and you would roll it.\n",
      "- The roller will be over your IT infrastructure and then it would sit in the, in the browser people are working with.\n",
      "- So and then it's able to cover any large language model.\n",
      "- Okay, perfect.\n",
      "- Let me see if this is working.\n",
      "- All right.\n",
      "- You see that?\n",
      "- Yes.\n",
      "- Let me check where I have to work.\n",
      "- Okay.\n",
      "- You see the screen?\n",
      "- Yes.\n",
      "- Okay.\n",
      "- Okay.\n",
      "- So I mean that's a problem in the beginning.\n",
      "- You can tell me how much I should talk about the program.\n",
      "- But I mean we know that AI is critical for companies to be more efficient, boost in productivity.\n",
      "- I think we don't need to talk about that.\n",
      "- Still.\n",
      "- It's in the presentation.\n",
      "- The thing is that 70% of companies in Germany identify data privacy violations while using AI.\n",
      "- So a lot of companies are stopping or do not let their employees work with AI as much as they could or not at all.\n",
      "- And this is leading to competitive disadvantage to and to a huge loss of efficiency boost right now.\n",
      "- So 40% of workers use bent AI tool even though they are not allowed to.\n",
      "- This is like the shadow usage I was talking about.\n",
      "- And this is huge problem because you have this DSG4.0, this data privacy law in Europe and the UAI Act.\n",
      "- And yes, and this is something we are going to solve because three problems.\n",
      "- AI is used by any B2B Z tool.\n",
      "- You have a broad shadow usage and you have enterprise data that is gold for AI, but you're not collecting it.\n",
      "- You know, as an enterprise you have a lot of people playing around with ChatGPT or whatever, doing translations, doing creative things with large language models.\n",
      "- And as a company you're not able to see it.\n",
      "- You know, there is like a lot of gold and data people spending the time working with large language models.\n",
      "- They will be trained with the data and not only the security risk, but even like intellectual property is leaving your house and your company and you're not collecting it.\n",
      "- And this is something what we want to enable.\n",
      "- So we want to control the usage data security, but we want to enable the workforce and the company to solve all these problems.\n",
      "- So we are not just a data security company.\n",
      "- We have an enterprise enablement platform to secure AI to govern AI and to adopt AI to have insights on your internal AI usage and to scale it with own AI models.\n",
      "- In the end there is a platform for management or executives to like directly look at the usage and like look at which like how privatizes that, like.\n",
      "- How, how much is like an anonymous.\n",
      "- It's not like pair employee, it's like per department or whatever.\n",
      "- You know, if you, if you have these.\n",
      "- We have four layers in the platform.\n",
      "- There's a shield.\n",
      "- The shield protects the, the usage, the sensitive data.\n",
      "- I show you the shield in a minute.\n",
      "- Then there are guardrails.\n",
      "- So if you drag a PDF or Word document within a large language model, there's a NANA AI overlay that tells you you're dragging a Word document in it.\n",
      "- We can cover the personal information, you can check it beforehand.\n",
      "- And as a company you can tell NANA AI to not allow an upload of contracts or not allow an upload of CVS or whatever or PDF in general.\n",
      "- And you can steer the usage of AI.\n",
      "- You can prohibit to use various LLMs.\n",
      "- You can say I don't want this LLM to be used, I want this to be used more often or whatever.\n",
      "- So you can, you have these guardrails which you can steer the whole AI usage and then you have the insights.\n",
      "- And that was your question.\n",
      "- You know, you have like, you can see like in a cockpit which LLMs are used by your stuff.\n",
      "- What are the prompts, what are they using it for?\n",
      "- And but with this knowledge you are able to build your own processes on it.\n",
      "- You can tell if people are doing a lot of translation.\n",
      "- You can think of how to optimize that for example, or if people are doing a lot of, I don't know, ideation for special topics.\n",
      "- You are able to see this and you are able to give them best practices how to prompt and even we are able to push best practices of prompts to the employee while writing on a prompt because we know what works best.\n",
      "- So you are not able just not only protecting the data, when you have installed Nano, you are able to see what they are working on.\n",
      "- You're able to steal within your company.\n",
      "- Not intercompany wise with data regulation.\n",
      "- That must not be possible.\n",
      "- It's just within a company.\n",
      "- Okay.\n",
      "- And this is the same thing.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- So we secure the data and people are able to work with LLMs.\n",
      "- We have higher productivity, we do this governance stuff.\n",
      "- So we have no liability risk.\n",
      "- We do this adoption with the insight.\n",
      "- So it's your data and it's the first time that you have like usage data with various LLMs, then you have a competitive advantage because you can scale that.\n",
      "- This is how it looks like.\n",
      "- You have the device of the employee that are installed and if it's contacts or emails or documents or whatever, you can use all AI services.\n",
      "- But the personal data is not leaving the device of the employee.\n",
      "- And this is why it's EU AI act and with compliance with data law in EU and in Germany, because it's not leaving the device of the employee.\n",
      "- To zoom in into the EU AI Act.\n",
      "- How enforced is that?\n",
      "- Has there been any fines or how should I see this?\n",
      "- There will be, there will be.\n",
      "- The companies need to be more or less ready mid of next year and next year and they need to show that they are compliant with the UAI act.\n",
      "- And there will be like there is the US building an AI, I call Task Force, different name right now and they're going to look into it.\n",
      "- And even this, oh, what is the word in English like you know, kpmg, Pricewater.\n",
      "- First they will look into it and see if you're compliant when it comes to this.\n",
      "- Annual.\n",
      "- Inspections of like an audit or like an audit.\n",
      "- It's like an art.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- And you need to be compliant and if not there is a risk of fees.\n",
      "- You have to.\n",
      "- And is that one of the selling points that like if you pitch this to some like a company, is that like one of the first things that you pitch as well in there?\n",
      "- Yes, it depends, you know, and we are not.\n",
      "- This is a huge reason for people.\n",
      "- We do some pilot cases right now and we do demos with companies in Germany, for example, publishing houses, with legal firms and with agencies.\n",
      "- And some see this efficiency boost.\n",
      "- Some are like, oh, now I can work with it.\n",
      "- This is great, you know, because I can let people I don't know compare CVS because the personal data is not in the CVS anymore.\n",
      "- You know, something like they see the user case.\n",
      "- But some are like, I met someone last week who told me this is a solution for all my legal problems with this data security stuff in the UAI act because they're really afraid of how should I deal with this shadow usage.\n",
      "- You know, maybe quickly one you mentioned, for example CVS just, just to get a better understanding also out of PDFs you can filter out.\n",
      "- Yes, in PDF.\n",
      "- I show you, I show you in a minute.\n",
      "- Let's, let's jump into the product.\n",
      "- Look, this is like Nana AI secures any itool because we are a plugin in the browser Chrome in Edge.\n",
      "- So we have it installed.\n",
      "- You see it in the front end, you have this, you have this layer and you can choose if it's on or it's off.\n",
      "- As a company you do default settings but just like you can say where it's on, normally it's on.\n",
      "- So it's there as a layer.\n",
      "- And then you have the shield here in the middle.\n",
      "- It controls the usage of AI with PAI and IP on the device of the employee.\n",
      "- So and then you have the governance cockpit and as a company or your enterprise AI team you can, you can tell Nana what is allowed and what is not allowed.\n",
      "- The employee cannot change it, you know, and this is like the rule set you set as a company and then they're able to work with it and you have to shield on the, on the computer of the employees.\n",
      "- And during the usage you gain the insights I talked about beforehand.\n",
      "- And it looks like this.\n",
      "- You have the browser plugin and if this is a chatgpt prompt, you see that there are names and there is a street and there's a city and a bank account and this is like the mail to I think an insurance company.\n",
      "- Do you recognize that with your own LLM or how do you recognize that?\n",
      "- Well, but we have a recognition software as part of our.\n",
      "- And that's run locally or how does that work?\n",
      "- It's run locally, yeah.\n",
      "- Okay, so in the true the browser itself or is there is it just an on premise cloud that you need to use for that or how does that work?\n",
      "- Through the browser?\n",
      "- Through the browser.\n",
      "- Through the browser.\n",
      "- So in the browser you run that.\n",
      "- Okay, interesting.\n",
      "- And do you also have like the platform itself?\n",
      "- So you mentioned you can see the usage etc do you also have like screenshots or something of a demo of that insights?\n",
      "- Not right now.\n",
      "- This is what we.\n",
      "- I show you in a minute.\n",
      "- This is like the insight is the next step, right?\n",
      "- What's life right now is the shield and the guardrails.\n",
      "- Okay.\n",
      "- And the Insights are going to be launched begin beginning of next year.\n",
      "- Okay.\n",
      "- And you see that okay, this is a prompt that I do you know and what Nana is doing.\n",
      "- You see that the person becomes like this.\n",
      "- The name is.\n",
      "- The LLM knows that it's a person and that is an email.\n",
      "- That is a phone number.\n",
      "- And the LLM knows that this.\n",
      "- So you can compare CVS for example because you know which person it is but just with this mask ask thing, you know.\n",
      "- So you have this on your fly masking company brands, phone number, whatever.\n",
      "- As a company you can do, I don't know, you can upload a set of 1,000 data points that you would like to have masked like brand names, client names, whatever.\n",
      "- And then the prompt is going to the LLM and it's no sensitive data or personal data.\n",
      "- With the LLM it stays on.\n",
      "- On premise of the, of the employee.\n",
      "- So the prompt output is working.\n",
      "- So here the subject was to write an email.\n",
      "- So it writes an email, it says dear Person, dear State, and then you copy this into your email program or Word or whatever and de mask the content and the name is there again, the bank account is there again, everything is there again.\n",
      "- And this happens on the computer of the employee.\n",
      "- So the LLM hasn't seen any sensitive data.\n",
      "- This is why it's compliant with data law.\n",
      "- And this is what you were asking.\n",
      "- If I drag a Word or PDF file into the browser, there is this nanoshield and it says you're uploading a PDF file.\n",
      "- It is masked.\n",
      "- Please check it before and so you can check it and then you see that with the PDF.\n",
      "- Yes, but with PDF you cannot retrieve the data.\n",
      "- It's just cover and that's it.\n",
      "- With Word it works like the same way as I showed you in the.\n",
      "- In the prompt and with the PDFs.\n",
      "- Does it?\n",
      "- Is it only for searchable PDFs that this is doable or does it.\n",
      "- Is it also working for like non searchable PDFs?\n",
      "- I'm not sure.\n",
      "- Okay.\n",
      "- I think it works with any PDF.\n",
      "- What is.\n",
      "- Yeah, like you know the, the PDF, sorry, you can like select the text and then you have PDF so you can't.\n",
      "- I'm not the technical guy, but I think it works with all PDFs.\n",
      "- Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "- And we can show you.\n",
      "- But we can show you a demo if you're interested.\n",
      "- A live demo of this.\n",
      "- Maybe for the time's sake, not now, but like I definitely.\n",
      "- If you have like a video or something or do you have like a clip of it?\n",
      "- No, I just have the screens right now.\n",
      "- Okay, I know.\n",
      "- If you would.\n",
      "- Yeah, we'll leave that for now because I think there's still a few things to do for time's sake.\n",
      "- I think the live demo is hard to see.\n",
      "- I'm done in three minutes.\n",
      "- So you see this data show policy details and whatever.\n",
      "- So you can use in different ways as a copy.\n",
      "- You can use it just as to be data safe.\n",
      "- And you say no personal data, no documents or whatever.\n",
      "- And so you're in control of the shadow usage.\n",
      "- But this is, let's say, the default case.\n",
      "- The more interesting case is to say what is allowed and let people work with it and not stopping the usage of AI in your company.\n",
      "- We have free packages, we have like it depends on the seat and of the functions you have.\n",
      "- So it starts with a team that's up to 20 seats, department is up to 150 seat enterprises up to 1000 seats and only with department you are able to start using these insights.\n",
      "- And as an enterprise you can do own insight models, own shield models and a custom AI.\n",
      "- This is not something we would do with a team, you know, you see, let's say the bigger it gets, the more individualization is there and the more you can, you can build your own functions with our tools.\n",
      "- So team is more or less what you see is what you get, you know.\n",
      "- And with enterprise you have more or less strategic partnership and you're working on how they really would like to work with these insights and have more functions within the shield and not just like the standard thing.\n",
      "- And how does that work pricing wise?\n",
      "- What should I like per seat or per company or.\n",
      "- I don't know how you do pricing.\n",
      "- Yeah, we are middle.\n",
      "- We are the 20 seats are like.\n",
      "- €300Amonth or just in general.\n",
      "- Or in general.\n",
      "- In general, yeah.\n",
      "- So we are looking for a long term login effect, you know, because as an enterprise if you have NANA installed, you have the shield and the guardrails.\n",
      "- But because with our tool you're able to have these insight and custom AI.\n",
      "- Yeah, we call it gravity.\n",
      "- We have this gravity effect or login effect that we are not just a protection software, we are an ailment software.\n",
      "- And it makes sense to work with us over a longer period of time and for not just for teams but for whole enterprises.\n",
      "- These are the sectors we are looking in.\n",
      "- Legal, we're working legal agencies, finance, you know, where data protection is very important as well Health and insurance and public sector and as well E commerce.\n",
      "- But right now we are focusing on legal agencies and finance and we are building pilot cases there.\n",
      "- These are with agencies.\n",
      "- Do you mean consultancy or what kind of agencies?\n",
      "- Yeah, like yes, agencies.\n",
      "- Like yes, it's good question.\n",
      "- Like different kind of agencies.\n",
      "- It's like could be brand agencies or marketing agencies, but they work with sensitive data as well.\n",
      "- You know when they are creating intellectual property or they don't want the large language model to know which client you're talking about.\n",
      "- Now it's done.\n",
      "- Okay, perfect.\n",
      "- These are some use cases.\n",
      "- I will spare them right now.\n",
      "- But this is legal.\n",
      "- You have to compare contract versions, automate emails, confidential data, CVS and hr.\n",
      "- This is like the agency stuff, idea generation Texting translation We have pilot cases in legal consulting and marketing right now and we are negotiating reselling partners.\n",
      "- So they.\n",
      "- It's a great distribution model for us because this is like a legal partner and a consulting agency and we have B2B pilots, their agencies.\n",
      "- There is a publishing and invest investment.\n",
      "- Houses as well to quickly zoom into that.\n",
      "- So like traction wise, how does that work?\n",
      "- Pilot cases, is that paid?\n",
      "- Not paid.\n",
      "- And.\n",
      "- Cases are demo cases that are not paid right now.\n",
      "- But the idea is to turn them into clients.\n",
      "- We do these pilot cases for free just to enter the market.\n",
      "- But the objective to end of year is to have five clients closed.\n",
      "- And what kind of action should you get out of that?\n",
      "- Or what are you aiming for?\n",
      "- Like traction wise, MRR or ARR wise?\n",
      "- Out of those end of year?\n",
      "- Yes.\n",
      "- Yeah, it's ARR.\n",
      "- End of year is more or less like 180 200,000.\n",
      "- And currently.\n",
      "- There'S no revenue.\n",
      "- Yeah, we're like we started go to market beginning of October, but next year we are aiming at 800k.\n",
      "- Okay.\n",
      "- Total revenue, not ARR total.\n",
      "- Because there's a lot of service fee in the setup itself or just currently.\n",
      "- No, it's, it's.\n",
      "- It's the seats and the contracts.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- So it is ARR.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- Excuse me.\n",
      "- So, so wait, you mentioned that the 800k is not ARR, but what is there like service associated?\n",
      "- Like total net revenue next year but.\n",
      "- Like just a part of that is service based or why, why is it not ARR?\n",
      "- Ah, okay.\n",
      "- No, ARR is.\n",
      "- Ah, no, for the next year the ARR is even higher when it comes to the yearly contracts and stuff like this.\n",
      "- It's not ARR because it's a total annual revenue, not recurring revenue, you know.\n",
      "- Yeah, so it's not recurring because there's service fees included in that 800k or why is it not recurring?\n",
      "- Service fees in it?\n",
      "- Yes.\n",
      "- Okay.\n",
      "- And how much?\n",
      "- Even higher because you have like I show you where is it?\n",
      "- So we start right now with just team setup and next year we have department clients and enterprise clients.\n",
      "- And let's assume that the enterprise client is stepping in like in March or in June and they have a yearly contract or even longer.\n",
      "- So this is how I understand it.\n",
      "- The total revenue next year, the ARR for 2026, well end of 2025 is more than 800k.\n",
      "- Okay, perfect.\n",
      "- Yeah, maybe for sake.\n",
      "- I'll try to like quickly go through the other questions.\n",
      "- So like two quick ones.\n",
      "- So you mentioned something with the founder setup.\n",
      "- I'm not completely Clear of what?\n",
      "- What, like how it currently works.\n",
      "- So you have Alexander, he's moving into more of a CTO function.\n",
      "- And you're joining as like a founder, as a CEO, right?\n",
      "- Or is that misunderstood?\n",
      "- Let's say I do the thing, a lot of the outbound stuff, events, marketing, sales.\n",
      "- And Alex is the founder, the technical brain and he's doing a lot of investor relations as well.\n",
      "- But you're joining more as like your late joining founder or how should I see that?\n",
      "- No, I was a very early founder, but I was working with a media company and digital department 12 years and my terms of notice was, were like six months.\n",
      "- So I was.\n",
      "- I co founded in May, but I just, I could start right now.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- Alex is a founder.\n",
      "- He did two exit within B2B and SaaS companies.\n",
      "- Alexis is a CTO, like the operating CTO.\n",
      "- And Florian is a business development.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- And maybe to zoom in, like just a quick question, like the website itself is like fully in German.\n",
      "- Is that because your current focus is just the German market or how should I see that?\n",
      "- This is something we see as a usp.\n",
      "- We communicate in German because we want to have trust.\n",
      "- We start in German, or let's say Dach as a German company and we want to build trust.\n",
      "- We do not want to be a company that is seated.\n",
      "- I don't know, somewhere.\n",
      "- We want to show our clients that we understand European law and German law and data protection and that we work with local servers only and all the tools we are using are compliant with data law, even our CRM.\n",
      "- So we want to build trust by communicating in German and we want to start in German market.\n",
      "- Yeah, I see that we're over the time limit.\n",
      "- Can I quickly grab like two more minutes or do you have a back to back?\n",
      "- Okay, sorry.\n",
      "- No worries.\n",
      "- Sorry for interrupting.\n",
      "- I just wanted to ensure.\n",
      "- No.\n",
      "- And the tool Nana AI is able to work in English.\n",
      "- Okay.\n",
      "- But we are focusing go to markets in Germany.\n",
      "- Right?\n",
      "- Okay.\n",
      "- Yeah, no, definitely.\n",
      "- Interesting.\n",
      "- And maybe to zoom into that like competition wise, how would you say, how would you place yourself in the space itself?\n",
      "- Like what is your main differentiator in comparison to.\n",
      "- So for the German thing made in Germany, we position ourselves that we are like.\n",
      "- We understand data, but we are an enablement platform.\n",
      "- I haven't seen our idea before and there's a lot of guardrail stuff and IT security and custom AI.\n",
      "- But we have a different approach when it comes to how you protect and enable people.\n",
      "- Because we sit there where the employees are working with AI.\n",
      "- We do not build like we are easy to install.\n",
      "- You can roll us roll out our software very fast and in a simple way.\n",
      "- And you do not need to build like huge IT infrastructures first and then understand how you are going to develop an own LLM and stuff.\n",
      "- Because we suggest in front of it.\n",
      "- So we our USP is that we make data protection feasible and possible with any AI.\n",
      "- So this is something we haven't seen in the market and this is very special.\n",
      "- And then it's for German companies.\n",
      "- Okay, maybe interesting to look at.\n",
      "- I just sent it in chat Collider.\n",
      "- They're like an Italian company who is like in a similar space.\n",
      "- Might be interesting for you to look at as well.\n",
      "- Of course as you mentioned, if one of your differentiators is currently like chairman.\n",
      "- It's different but might be interesting to see them as well.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- Maybe to quickly look into like what you're searching for.\n",
      "- Like are you currently raising or what is your timeline raising wise.\n",
      "- We have angel investment.\n",
      "- Okay.\n",
      "- These are our angels and they support us by with the go to market.\n",
      "- A lot of knowledge in B2B SaaS and agency as well.\n",
      "- What we are looking for right now we have an angel invest of approximately 300k with a post money evaluation of 2.5 million and we are looking into 1.5 to 2 million let's say end of year, beginning of next year to be able to scale and to be able to invest in marketing and more people team stuffing sales and building the product.\n",
      "- So ideally you would be done raising before your revenue.\n",
      "- Like it would be like kind of a pre revenue round because you mentioned or like you mentioned that you're trying to get the revenue like end of year.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- So it's like starting to be there.\n",
      "- Okay.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- And what kind of valuation are you looking at for the 1.5 to 2?\n",
      "- We need to talk about that.\n",
      "- Do you have like a range?\n",
      "- I don't want to like hard fit you to something but I just want like if there's a range that you already have in mind.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- For what?\n",
      "- Yeah, for us it would be to pose to be a 10 million evaluation and total web.\n",
      "- Okay.\n",
      "- I know it's in no way to like.\n",
      "- I just need like based on the.\n",
      "- Model and the setup and what kind of investment it is.\n",
      "- So you know I'm.\n",
      "- I was just.\n",
      "- It's hard to say if you do not know the.\n",
      "- I totally.\n",
      "- It's just like as mentioned like I have an internal debrief about this later and it's just easier if I have like some guidelines of what the amount is.\n",
      "- It's in no way to, like, have a gotcha moment after this, so no worries about that.\n",
      "- Yeah, no, definitely.\n",
      "- Interesting.\n",
      "- Thank you for your time.\n",
      "- I really enjoyed hearing about it.\n",
      "- Really interesting space as well.\n",
      "- And, yeah, as mentioned, I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible with potential next steps.\n",
      "- If you could send me your slides as well, that would make my life a bit easier.\n",
      "- Yeah.\n",
      "- Thank you so much.\n",
      "- Yeah, of course.\n",
      "- Thank you very much.\n",
      "- Have a nice day.\n",
      "- Bye.\n",
