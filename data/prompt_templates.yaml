Website Analysis: "You are an expert in analyzing companies based on the following\
  \ dictionary of website links and their corresponding content. You are provided\
  \ with a company's website scraped content stored in the following dictionary format\
  \ (link1:content1, link2:content2, ...):\n\n{website_data}\n\nAnalyze the content\
  \ and return the following details in the exact format specified:\n\nProduct/Service:\
  \ <Short, straightforward description of the company\u2019s main product or service,\
  \ e.g., \"Automated quality control inspection for fresh produce to reduce waste.\"\
  >\nIndustry: <Simplified industry classification, e.g., \"E-commerce,\" \"EdTech,\"\

Website Software-Hardware Classification: "You are an expert in identifying whether\
  \ a company's core offerings are \"Software\" or \"Hardware\" based on provided\
  \ website content. Below is a dictionary of website URLs and their corresponding\
  \ content summaries, structured as link1: content1, link2: content2, etc.\n\nGuidelines:\n\
  1. Classify as \"Hardware\" if the company sells or primarily provides a physical\
  \ product, device, or equipment as part of its core offering. This includes any\
  \ company where at least one primary product involves a physical component sold\
  \ by the company.\n2. Classify as \"Software\" if the company provides purely digital\
  \ solutions\u2014such as applications, SaaS platforms, online tools, or cloud-based\
  \ services\u2014without selling any physical product. If the solution is digital\
  \ but involves a physical product owned by the client (e.g., an app that runs on\
  \ client hardware), it should still be classified as \"Software\".\n\nUsing these\
  \ criteria, output a binary classification:\n- \"1\" for a Software company\n- \"\
  0\" for a Hardware company\n\n{website_data}\n"
Website Software-Service Classification: "You are an expert in distinguishing companies\
  \ as either \"SaaS\" (Software as a Service) or \"Service\" providers, based on\
  \ the information given. Below is a dictionary of website URLs and their corresponding\
  \ content summaries, structured as link1: content1, link2: content2, etc.\n\nClassification\
  \ Guidelines:\n1. Classify as \"SaaS\" if the company's primary offering is a purely\
  \ software-based platform or application that customers access online, typically\
  \ subscription-based and self-service, without needing direct human involvement\
  \ to deliver the service.\n2. Classify as \"Service\" if the company\u2019s primary\
  \ offerings involve services delivered manually by individuals, such as consulting,\
  \ advisory, agency work, or other human-driven activities.\n\nProvide a binary output:\n\
  - \"1\" for SaaS\n- \"2\" for Service\n\n{website_data}\n"
