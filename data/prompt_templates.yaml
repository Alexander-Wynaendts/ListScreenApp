  \ about the types of clients the company serves.\r\n\r\nIgnore URLs related to blogs,\

Website Analysis: "You are an expert in analyzing companies based on the following\
  \ dictionary of website links and their corresponding content. You are provided\
  \ with a company's website scraped content stored in the following dictionary format\
  \ (link1:content1, link2:content2, ...):\r\n\r\n{data}\r\n\r\nAnalyze the content\
  \ and return the following details in the exact format specified:\r\n\r\nProduct/Service:\
  \ <Short, straightforward description of the company\u2019s main product or service,\
  \ e.g., \"Automated quality control inspection for fresh produce to reduce waste.\"\

Website Software-Hardware Classification: "You are an expert in identifying whether\
  \ a company's core offerings are \"Software\" or \"Hardware\" based on provided\
  \ website content. Below is a dictionary of website URLs and their corresponding\
  \ content summaries, structured as link1: content1, link2: content2, etc.\r\n\r\n\
  Guidelines:\r\n1. Classify as \"Hardware\" if the company sells or primarily provides\
  \ a physical product, device, or equipment as part of its core offering. This includes\
  \ any company where at least one primary product involves a physical component sold\
  \ by the company.\r\n2. Classify as \"Software\" if the company provides purely\
  \ digital solutions\u2014such as applications, SaaS platforms, online tools, or\
  \ cloud-based services\u2014without selling any physical product. If the solution\
  \ is digital but involves a physical product owned by the client (e.g., an app that\
  \ runs on client hardware), it should still be classified as \"Software\".\r\n\r\
  \nUsing these criteria, output a binary classification:\r\n- \"1\" for a Software\
  \ company\r\n- \"0\" for a Hardware company\r\n\r\n{data}"
Website Software-Service Classification: "You are an expert in distinguishing companies\
  \ as either \"SaaS\" (Software as a Service) or \"Service\" providers, based on\
  \ the information given. Below is a dictionary of website URLs and their corresponding\
  \ content summaries, structured as link1: content1, link2: content2, etc.\r\n\r\n\
  Classification Guidelines:\r\n1. Classify as \"SaaS\" if the company's primary offering\
  \ is a purely software-based platform or application that customers access online,\
  \ typically subscription-based and self-service, without needing direct human involvement\
  \ to deliver the service.\r\n2. Classify as \"Service\" if the company\u2019s primary\
  \ offerings involve services delivered manually by individuals, such as consulting,\
  \ advisory, agency work, or other human-driven activities.\r\n\r\nProvide a binary\
  \ output:\r\n- \"1\" for SaaS\r\n- \"2\" for Service\r\n\r\n{data}"
